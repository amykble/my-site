## Information about The Site

This repo hosts all of the files for my personal site. It's public so if you're interested in seeing how I built it feel free to take a look! I'm currently using Gridsome to build the site, with Prismic to add content to the blog and portfolio pages. Enjoy ðŸ’š

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see all updates to this project.
